# nextflow-metagenomics-pipeline

### Overview
In this repository, I am building a Nextflow metagenomics pipeline for my master's thesis data, where I conducted metagenomic analysis on 60 samples/raw reads and transformed them into biologically meaningful results for functional annotation. This analysis explores an alternative strategy for microbial communities compared to the conventional method of photosynthesis. This pipeline is designed to test my hypothesis through metagenomic analysis. For full context, please refer to this repository: https://github.com/shivabioinformatics/metagenomic-pipeline

During my analysis throughout my master's program, I encountered numerous errors during the process, and sometimes my analysis would crash, setting me back for weeks and sometimes months.
During this process, I learned about Nextflow for processing and automating pipelines, and I began to appreciate how Nextflow helps organize both my thought process and the analysis workflow.
Therefore, I am rewriting my pipeline in Nextflow to make it reproducible for others and as good practice for learning Nextflow.
